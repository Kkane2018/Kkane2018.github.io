<h1> My Pets </h1>

<ul> I have a dog named Bella. She is about seven years old now. She is very sweet and loves to cuddle!
    She also has a playful side, playing fetch with her toys and run around the house.
    She is a golden labradoodle.    </ul>

<ul> My cat named Jollie. Jollie is very playful loves to play with the fish tank in our house. Luckly he hasn't killed any fish yet!
    We rescued him from a shelter in Maine, and it was one of the best decsions we made as a family.
    His exact age is not known but he is somewhere around 9 years old now. My family and I are so
happy to have Jollie in our lives. </ul>

<ul> My dad also has a tank of fish. He has angle fish and several
    other kids in the same tank. </ul>


<ul>This is a picture is of both my dog and cat.
They love to play with each other and chase each other around
    inside my house as well as outside in our yard. </ul>
